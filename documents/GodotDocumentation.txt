Godot would be a helpful game engine for us to use because of its ease of access. Its alot
simpler to use than libraries like SDL or raylib especially since we can basically drag and drop
assets which would make map creation much easier. There is also alot of documentation about
it and it seems like a more modern tool to build our project on. Its written in C/C++ which we all
have experience on, its also written in gdscript
