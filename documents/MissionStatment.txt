Stop buggin' is a tower defense game inspired other games of in the genre like Bloons Tower Defense, Kingdom Rush, Plants vs Zombies, etc. Each map features waves of enemy bugs following a fixed track until an exit is reached resulting in a loss of lives. Running out of said lives will cause the player to lose and have to restart that map. To prevent this,  squares arranged in a grid like pattern around the track will house spots for the player to build and upgrade animals (towers) that will attack and disrupt the bugs. By destroying bugs, the player earns food that can be used as currency to buy and upgrade more towers which in exchange allows them to destroy more bugs.
    While the game can appeal to all gamers, our target audience are young teenagers due to overall simple gameplay that tower defense games provide. We'll emphasize bright colors and fun, cartoonish towers without any bad language, horror, violence, etc. Stop buggin' also provides a tutorial for players to pick up the basics along with an experience based progression system to unlock all towers and upgrades to prevent overwhelming brand new players. Contrarily, the game also provides different difficulties and maps which will provide more experienced players with more of a challenge.
