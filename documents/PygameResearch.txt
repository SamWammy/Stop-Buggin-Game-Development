Pygame is a fair competitor to SDL… mostly because it is a python wrapper for SDL. This gives
it some of the benefits of SDL, with more benefits of python. Building upon SDL allows it to get
some performance that python would want. It being python based allows for faster development,
because it’s python. The faster development only continues with pygame coming with a large
number of helper functions to do things like load sprites, draw shapes, and some nicer audio
library stuff.
