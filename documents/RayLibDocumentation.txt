I feel like using raylib as our programming library would be a good option because it provides us
with lots of materials to refer to which can be helpful considering everyone is relatively new to
game development. It’s also written in C which everyone in our group has experience with, there
is also documentation for the library functions given as well. It can provide a good foundation to
begin with, and as we become more and more accustomed to the library we can build upon our
project and make it more suited to our vision
