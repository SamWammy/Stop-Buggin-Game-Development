    -C++ reference, since we’d probably use C++ over pure C.

I think SDL is a good option because we all have experience in C, and C++ isn’t THAT different.
It also handles most of the harder things like loading a window(platform independent), user
input, and sound. It will also be a fun challenge to use a lower level language, at least for me. It
is MORE work, but this can be a good thing with allowing more work for sprints, since with an
engine we might finish early. But this can be a bad thing because we may want to use this
project as a resume project.
